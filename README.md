# Secure-Cloud-Storage-for-Google-Drive
Assignment 2 for Advanced Computer Networks Module

**BRIEF**

TThe aim of this project is to develop a secure cloud storage application for Dropbox, Box, Google 
Drive, Office365 etc. For example, your application will secure all files that are uploaded to the cloud, 
such that only people that are part of your “Secure Cloud Storage Group” will be able to decrypt 
uploaded files. Any member of the group should be able to upload encrypted files to the cloud service. 
To all other users the files will be encrypted.
You are required to design and implement a suitable key management system for your application 
which employs public-key certificates that allows users of the system to share files securely, and also 
allows one to add or remove users from the group. You are free to implement your application for a 
desktop or mobile platform and make use of any open source cryptographic libraries.
